#The society description
lord_alliance_desc;The Lords' Alliance, also known as the Council of Lords, was a partnership of merchant cities founded in 1325 DR. Its members were from the Sword Coast, the North and Western Heartlands, including Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Baldur's Gate, and Neverwinter, as well as other free cities and towns in the region, which made up the bulk of the organization. It was formed to oppose the growing influence of the Black Network in the North, as well as the Shadow Thieves of Amn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
